Long ago, there was a lake at the edge of the world known as the Mirror Lake. 
Its waters were so still and clear that they reflected the stars above, and it was said that if one looked deeply into its surface, they could glimpse the future.

But the lake was guarded by a single, silver fish—the last of its kind, known as the Silverfin. 
The people believed that as long as the Silverfin swam in the lake, the waters would stay pure, and the visions within would be true.

One year, a drought struck the land, and the lake began to dry. 
People grew desperate and sought to catch the Silverfin, believing it held the secret to endless water. Many tried, but the fish was swift and elusive, avoiding every net and hook. Yet as more people attempted to capture it, the lake grew cloudy, and the visions faded.

In time, the villagers realized their greed was draining the lake’s magic. 
Instead of trying to catch the Silverfin, they began to guard the lake, bringing water from distant rivers to keep it full. And as they did, the lake cleared once more, and the Silverfin returned to swim in peace.

Since then, it’s said that the lake shows the future only to those who come with pure hearts and unclouded minds, 
a reminder that some gifts are meant to be protected, not possessed.
